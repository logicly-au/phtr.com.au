  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>PHTR</strong> (Peter Hogg + Toby Reed Architects) is an award winning practice focused on ideas based research, sustainable architecture, interiors and urban design. Working on a pre-existing collaborative relationship that spanned back to 2004, Peter Hogg of PH Architects and Toby Reed of Nervegna Reed Architecture, formed PHTR officially in 2011. PHTR has gained international recognition for their Precinct Energy Project (PEP) in Dandenong, the first precinct in Australia to be powered by co-generation, leading the way in the provision of green energy in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both principles have a strong belief in community based architecture and design, tailoring each design to its individual and community needs. Peter Hogg has designed multi-residential social housing projects and also has a strong background in Aboriginal housing, having designed many projects for Indigenous communities around Australia. Toby Reed’s design projects have been widely published around the world and have won a number of awards. Toby has also undertaken a number of cross-disciplinary design projects such as video installations for the RMIT Gallery, RMIT Design Hub, the Melbourne Festival (2000 and 2003) and the Singapore Festival (2003).

  <p>
    Peter Hogg and Toby Reed have undertaken a variety of architectural projects focusing on the creation of sustainable communities. These projects include the PEP in Dandenong and master-plans and designs for Tri-generation centres, as well as the development of Australian suburban passive-house prototypes for our local conditions, and the implementation of the passive-house technology into individual housing projects. PHTR’s focus is on the combination of cultural ideas and environmental research, and how these can combine in the design of architecture, interiors and urban design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both Peter Hogg and Toby Reed have taught in the architecture department at RMIT University and currently at the University of Melbourne, which helps inform their research based design approach.
