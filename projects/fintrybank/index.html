      <p><strong>
				Social Housing Project<br>
				In association with Michael Taylor Architecture and Heritage
			</strong></p>
			<p>
				This social housing project was designed for Ecumenical Community Housing, and comprises of 10 units. Embedded in the 19th century fabric of inner city Melbourne, the project was part restoration of existing but dilapidated 19th century houses and part design of new walk up units. The new Units had to fit into the 19th century urban fabric without reproducing the style of the existing buildings. The spaces between the buildings were carefully designed to create social meeting spaces, evoking the laneways and parks of the 19th century Melbourne.
