				The ECB master-plan for Officer was to be a Tri-generation plant which would supply green energy as well as hot and chilled water for cooling to the town centre. The project is a master-plan for a complete city block comprising of the tri-generation plant, a plaza, shops and offices with ramps, lifts and stairs providing access through the site and the various levels of the development.

				The area near the site was famed for the shower of meteorites that littered the area more than 1000 years ago, and which subsequently became an important focus for the local indigenous population. Taking a cue from this we saw the building forms as a cluster of meteorite-like screens placed randomly on the site. The screens then have screens within them each with separate images from Eadweard Muybridge that would animate as one moved past the buildings. The images of the cowboy, cow and giant bird face the train tracks, evoking the silent cinema, for which the train was so important (the Lumiereâ€™s Train arriving at the Station and The Great Train Robbery).
