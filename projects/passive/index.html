			This addition to the rear of an art deco house in Melbourne has adapted European ‘passive-house’ technology to the Australian context. Utilising super insulation, air-tight membranes, triple glazing, and heat exchange ventilation systems, and making allowances for the warmer climate of Melbourne, PHTR have expanded their investigations into green energy explored in their Precinct Energy Project (Dandenong) into the domestic sphere.

			The clients have owned a cockatoo for the last 30 years. Being part of the family, the design of the cocky cage, was integral to the overall design of the project. The cocky was eager for this part of the project to be a homage to Cedric Price.
