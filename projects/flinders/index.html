<p>		The proposal aims to restore and protect the heritage buildings of Flinders Street Station while also making them a popular destination for locals and tourists.</p>
<p>			This will primarily be achieved by refiguring the historic administration buildings as an Art Hotel, the new Urban Park with its attendant functions (park, pool / ice skating, ‘drive-in cinema’ for bikes and pedestrians, amphitheatre, shops) as well as the new western buildings and their various functions (a university building including multi-storey golf driving ranges and indoor rock climbing over the Yarra river view, and an office building  with shopping centre which also houses the station administration). </p>
<p>			The new Urban Park will cover the existing platforms (with the canopies retained under), linking down to the river on one side, and to the CBD on the other sides, (while maintaining the important view lines) and to the new commercial developments on the western Banana Alley end of the site (which do not overshadow Southbank). The Urban Park serves as a connection point for the station to connect to the CBD and river: The functions on the Urban Park, as well as the new buildings will pull people up from surrounding CBD streets and then back down to the river (and reverse). The Urban Park will be a place for people to enjoy a futuristic urban park (which combines the best of the traditional park with the new) and contemplate and enjoy the river (unlike Federation Square which in many ways ignores the river). The placing of a water taxi terminal at the bottom of the plaza will enhance this position and create a new mode of transport for the station. It is perceived that the Urban Park will in time form an urban destination and ant-track between the CBD and river.</p>
<p>			Much of the site is at present under-utilised, both functionally and economically. The proposal aims to make the station work better as a station, as well as connecting the city to the river through the creation of a usable public space with exciting functions, while also making the site more economically viable through the building complex at the Banana Alley end of the site. These new buildings are massed so they do not obstruct views of the historic buildings from Southbank, and do not cast shadows on Southbank. The proposal endeavours to make the transport function clear and directional for the commuter, avoiding unnecessary confusion.The heritage value of the existing historic buildings is a central motivation of the design concept, as is the urban fabric of Melbourne’s CBD and the river. The proposal attempts to maintain the heritage value of the site while augmenting it with new iconic and dynamic buildings, urban space and spectacle.</p>

<p>			In order to create a connection with both the CBD and the river the proposal attempts to heighten this juncture between the man-made geometries of the CBD and the natural geometry of the Yarra river: The buildings appear to be one geometry (circle, arrow) when viewed from a certain position (Princess Bridge), then appear scattered and natural (from Southbank) before forming into other geometric shapes (triangle, pyramid) from other positions (Queens Bridge).
