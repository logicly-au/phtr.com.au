			Officer Energy Hub is a project for a portable Tri-generation building. The enclosure is comprised of a number of containers each housing part of the Tri-generation plant, which can be moved easily to site. The compound was to be made of expanded mesh and would keep the site secure and activate the streetscape at the same time.
